# Introduction

As I was reading {cite}`cryptomath`, I found myself wanting to do the exercises and save the work in a readable format.   The exercises consist of mathematical proofs (where writing equations would be helpful), and programming exercises.  I decided that using Jupyter Notebooks and incorporating  [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and organizing as a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) would be a decent approach.

Besides, I wanted to get more experience using those tools.

The book content is organized around how the exercises are presented in {cite}`cryptomath`.  The exercises completed here are ones I thought were interstesting to do and represent my own personal choices.
